this is the readme file for the apples for gold game

game_drill.py is written using python 3.4 and run on IDLE

the concept is that you run the program in IDLE,
buy apples , trade them for gold
having 57 million in gold wins the game

this script has a Class called GameLoot which
manages the game

playGame() is the loop which runs through the game

main() instantiates the GameLoot() class,
shows a greeting
and runs play_game() until the user quits
